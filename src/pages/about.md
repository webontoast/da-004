Douglas Architects is an architecture and design studio based in\
London and set up by Craig Douglas. We work on new and existing homes, interiors and furniture design.

Recently completed projects include the renovation of a Grade II* listed building in Soho, the refurbishment and extension of a brick farm cottage in Suffolk, two bespoke cedar clad garden office studios in Stoke Newington and an extension to a terraced house in West Hampstead.  Regardless of size or location, our goal is to pay attention to detail at all stages of our projects in order to make building work for our clients.

The studio is led by Craig who has over 25 years experience working in architecture. He worked in Dusseldorf, Berlin and Dublin before moving to London in 1999. He has designed projects on greenfield and brownfield sites and has worked with listed and locally listed buildings.

Craig is a visiting lecturer at the London School of Film, Media & Design at University of West London.

Douglas Architects is an RIBA Chartered Practice and alongside the full architecture and design service we also offer specialist services including interior design, feasibility studies and planning applications.
