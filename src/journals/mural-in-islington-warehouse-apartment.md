We have recently designed and installed a mural in a warehouse apartment in Islington. The mural  is spread out over two walls and the ceiling of the stairwell. This is the last part of the project where we have extended and re-configured the existing apartment and worked with the client to complete the interior design as well. The project required planning permission for the installation of a new roof light and involved working closely everyone involved – including the contractor and suppliers for furniture, fittings and finishes.
