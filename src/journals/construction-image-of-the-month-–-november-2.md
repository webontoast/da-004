Our project to create a new roof terrace in Highgate is now complete. In order to create the terrace we had to cut away a large section of the existing pitched roof. So in the end, this project consisted more of subtracting than adding, which is not usually the way with architectural projects, but it has worked well here. We extended the existing timber stair so that it can go directly to the terrace and we added a large glazed screen to separate the terrace from the stairs. This screen allows light to flood down into the centre of the house and gives great views of the sky and the activity on the terrace.
