Our project to renovate and transform a house in Clissold Crescent in Stoke Newington is nearing completion. We designed a glass infill side return extension and we renovated the existing roof terrace using a glass balustrade system.  For both items the glass was designed, supplied and installed by Glass Tec Systems.
