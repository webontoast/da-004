Light seems to enjoy playing in a different way in empty buildings than it does in inhabited buildings. Empty buildings and building sites often make beautiful places. They are  somehow full of the past while at the same time hinting at what the future might look like. We like to try to maintain some of this sense of the space and light when we are renovating and extending buildings.
