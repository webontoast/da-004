We have reached the roof on our project to add a two-storey side extension to a house in Stoke Newington. We have extended the existing roof with what is called a “cut roof”. This term is used where the roof structure is made up in timber on site. A trussed roof is where trusses are made up (usually off site) and then put into position. A cut roof was used in this instance as we needed to cut back the existing roof and then extend the structure to suit the dimensions of the new extension. Building control will be visiting the site next week and following on from that we will start adding the roof tiles.
