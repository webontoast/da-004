This photo shows how we are adapting the roof  structure on a 1970’s terraced house in Belsize Park. We are going to raise the ceiling line to run just under the rafters. We will also add two large frameless roof  lights in order to really give the room a boost. This is work is part of a program of total refurbishment and extension for the house.
