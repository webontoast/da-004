We spent two weeks working in Berlin this summer â€“ meeting up with old work colleagues and seeing how much things have changed over the last 20 years. The two projects that really got us thinking about all the changes were Berlin Tempelhof Airport (scene of die Luftbrucke and the Raisin Bombers) which has now become a park and the Neues Museum which has been restored with incredible care and attention by David Chipperfield Architects with Julian Harrap Architects.
