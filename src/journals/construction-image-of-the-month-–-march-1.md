The screed is being laid at our project to renovate and extend a house in Tower Hamlets. The screed is laid on top of the insulation which has a silver foil face. The white pipes that are clipped to the top face of the insulation and run through the screed are under floor heating pipes. The screed will be dry enough to walk in in a few days. In a few weeks time concrete tiles will be grouted on top of the screed to give a hard wearing finish that will be comfortable to walk on in bare feet in the winter.
