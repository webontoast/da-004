This image was taken during the refurbishment and extension of the stables building on Kingsland Road in Hackney. It goes some way to explaining the complexity of interlacing old, new and temporary structures in the roof space.  Things got more complicated as services went in – and getting the temporary structure out at the end of the construction work was not easy either!
