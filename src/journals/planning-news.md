Planning and Listed Building Consent have been granted for our project to renovate and extend a Grade 2 Listed terraced house on Nelson Terrace in Islington. This is the third listed building we have worked on in Islington and we are looking forward to getting stuck in to the detail design and construction stages of the project.

In other planning news, our project for two semi-detached houses in Hornchurch has been recommended for approval and we are now waiting for solicitors to arrange and agree the Section 106 agreements that our client is required to enter into with the council.
