We are currently working on the construction of a two storey extension to a house in Stoke Newington. This image shown the ground floor slab in progress. We are using a “beam and block” system for the slab as we need to span over a Thames Water sewer that runs under the property. The top face of the blocks will be covered with a cement mix before we build up off that with a layer of insulation and then a layer of screed  – then we will be ready for floor finishes.
