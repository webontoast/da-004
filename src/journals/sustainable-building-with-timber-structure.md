Our project to build a mansard loft extension with a roof terrace in Hackney is nearing completion. 

We worked with structural engineers, Conisbee and the main contractor, LLAC to design and build as much of the structure as possible in timber. This is a more sustainable way of building and it is lighter and easier to manage on site. For many areas of construction detailing, the timber structure also has the added benefit of improving the thermal performance of the building – this is because timber forms less of a “cold bridge” from outside to inside as it is a better insulator than steel. 

The project is due for completion in July.
