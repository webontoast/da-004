Our project to build a mansard loft extension with a roof terrace in Hackney is nearing completion. We worked hard with the structural engineers, Conisbee and the main contractor, LLAC to build as much of the structure as possible in timber. This helped to make the structure lighter and easier to manage on site - as well as being the more sustainable option. In the end, we had to introduce one steel beam into the project - we didn't want to do it, but the twin constraints of overall roof-height requirements and the need for good levels of insulation in the roof pushed us doewn this route. The project is due for completion in June this year.
