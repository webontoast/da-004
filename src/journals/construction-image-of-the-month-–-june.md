We are moving into the closing stages on our project to refurbish and extend a house in Belsize Avenue. This image starts to get across the amount of technology that is hidden within the walls of contemporary dwellings. We can see all the electrical and data cabling alongside the hot water pipework for the underfloor heating. Out of the picture, but equally important is the ductwork for the heat exchange system that we have also installed.
