We have started work on refurbishing a second apartment at Clissold Court in Stoke Newington. The building was built in the 1930s and is Grade 2 Listed. This image shows the calm before the storm before the building works begin. The jury is still out as to whether or not we should keep the original tiles on the fire place!
