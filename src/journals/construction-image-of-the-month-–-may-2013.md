We really like all the wonderful textures in this image. It was taken during the conversion of a house in Notting Hill Gate. The timber framed structure in the foreground is the main structural wall in the middle of the house – many Victorian houses are built like this in London. Eventually the frame structure was removed and replaced with a steel beam.
