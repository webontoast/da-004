Our project to renovate and extend a detached family house in Whitstable, Kent is well underway. Lots of demolition work has been carried out and the foundations and below ground drainage are nearly complete. 

From a construction point of view, the interesting part is coming soon â€“ which is where the new extension will connect to the existing house.
