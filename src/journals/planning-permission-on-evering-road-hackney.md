We just heard that we have succeeded in obtaining planning permission for a large rear extension to a property on Evering Road in Hackney. The property is in the Northwold and Cazenove Conservation Area and was achieved with good contact with the Hackney planning department.

We currently have two other projects in Hackney: The refurbishment and extension of a family house on Allerton Road and the refurbishment of a flat in Clissold Court, which is Grade 2 Listed. Both projects are nearing completion now and we will have some nice photos very soon!
