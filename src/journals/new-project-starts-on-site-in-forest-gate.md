Our project to extend and renovate a terraced house in Forest Gate has started on site. It involves a two storey side extension and a single storey rear extension. The extensions are built with timber framed structure using the same techniques as our two timber framed projects in Stoke Newington. The project is due for completion in April 2019.Â Here is a site progress photo that we thought had something interesting about it!
