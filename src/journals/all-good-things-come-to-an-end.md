I got a long way with the development of the Stoke Newington Youth Girls Football Club – we grew from 3 or 4 girls and one coach (me) to around 25 girls and 5 or 6 coaches (all dads). It was a great experience but at the end of last season I decided it was time to step down. 5 years of running Sunday morning football sessions started to catch up with me!

The other coaches were keen to keep things going so we went on a recruitment/arm-twisting drive and found a handful of new coaches to take things forward. I’m really pleased to say that our succession planning worked and the club continues to go from strength to strength.

The club was featured in an article in the Architects Journal not long after we set up under the heading “My Other Life….As a Football Coach” You can see more about that [here](http://douglasarchitects.co.uk/writing/my-other-life/)
