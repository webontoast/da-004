Our project to extend, refurbish and re-model a Victorian terrace house in Allerton Road, Stoke Newington is nearing completion. The project is a great example of close collaboration between the client, the architect and the builder, with the client running the project from tender stage onwards. Finishing touches are being made and everything should be complete in the new year.
