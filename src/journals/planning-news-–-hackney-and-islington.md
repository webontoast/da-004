We had a good couple of months with the planners in November and December this year; We obtained planning permission for our project to extend a house in Carysfort Road in Stoke Newington. The project included retaining an informal roof terrace which will be a fantastic space when it is back in use. We also obtained planning permission to extend an apartment in Goswell Road in Islington. Both projects have started on site and will be complete in early 2015.
