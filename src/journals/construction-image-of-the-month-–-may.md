We are just about to start on the finishes at our project to refurbish and extend a 1970’s house in Belsize Park. I like the pattern made in the existing plaster which has been made in order to form a key for the glue for the new plasterboard that is just about to be applied. On the right in the picture we are starting to see the amount of cabling required in a contemporary house – there is a lot there already, but there is still more to come.
