Douglas Architects has been asked to design an extension for a derelict crofters cottage on the slopes of Hergest Ridge in Wales. Hergest Ridge forms part of Offas Dyke which separates Wales from England. The valley is so beautiful we felt obliged to put a picture of it here before we have even put pen to paper for the design!
