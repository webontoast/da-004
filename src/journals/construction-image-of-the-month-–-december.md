We are working on the design for the refurbishment and extension for a building in Belsize Avenue near Hampstead Heath. With this extension – as with many others, there was a point between removing the existing structure and inserting the new structure when the building had to be held up on what seems like a very small amount of temporary works. The vertical elements are Acrow props and these props attach to the existing masonry either with removable plates called Strongboys or they support the steel beams that have been cut through the wall above which are also part of the temporary propping procedure. The site didn’t look like this for long though- the steel picture frame that supports the back of the house was installed less than a day after the picture was taken.
