Planning permission is the key to most projects. Being based in Hackney for the last 12 years we spent a lot of time at Douglas and King Architects dealing with the planners and we got to know them quite well. We achieved planning permission for our clients on listed buildings, in gardens and on rooftops all over the borough. The drawings in this blog show a series of rooftop extension projects, which were granted planning permission in Hackney within the last 3 years. Douglas Architects has continued to work well with Hackney Planning and we Â currently have two planning applications in Stoke Newington recommended for approval.
