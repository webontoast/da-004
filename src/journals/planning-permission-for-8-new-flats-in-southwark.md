We are really pleased that planning permission has just been granted for our scheme to convert and extend an existing building on Camberwell Road in Southwark. The project will provide 8 new flats on the upper floors and 3 retail units on the ground floor. The site has been the subject of a number of applications for planning permission over the last few years and we are looking forward to seeing the proposals move forward to bring some life back to this under-used corner of the Walworth Road Conservation Area.
