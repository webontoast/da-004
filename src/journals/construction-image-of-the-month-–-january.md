Work has just started on our new project to refurbish a terraced house in Tower Hamlets in London. The stripping out is well underway and we are in the process of arranging visits from the structural engineer and the building control inspector before we finalise some key elements of the structural design. This image demonstrates the almost archeological nature of stripping back the surfaces of old buildings before we start rebuilding them.
