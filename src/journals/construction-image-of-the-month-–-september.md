This picture shows a contractor setting out the reinforcing bars in the basement slab of a new house that we completed. The side walls of the pit are formed by contiguous piled walls, which are finished off at the top with a capping beam. After the mayhem of demolition, piling and digging there is a (short) period of relative calm before things get going again.
