Newham Council have granted planning permission for our proposal for a new brick and timber clad house overlooking Wansetad Flats. We are looking forward to getting into the detail design stage for this project â€“ the roof geometry will provide an interesting structural design challenge and the detailing and materials will need to be arranged to get across the idea that the first floor is as much of a tree house as a living space.
