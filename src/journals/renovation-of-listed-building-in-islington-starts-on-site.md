Our project to refurbish and extend a terraced house in Islington started on site yesterday. The house forms part of a large terrace that was built in 1802 and is Grade 2 listed. It is located within the Duncan Terrace / Colebrook Row conservation area. The construction work will be separated out into three separate contracts. Works to renovate the windows is the first of these contract to be undertaken. Internal remodelling and refurbishment will make up the second contract and works to remodel and extend the basement and ground floor level will make up the third contract. All of the works will be complete by the end of this year.
