We have had some good news on our planning applications recently â€“ permission has been granted for our proposal to extend a locally listed building in Northwood and permission has been granted to create a roof terrace on a beautiful Edwardian building in Highgate. We have been asked to take both of these projects forward to construction in Spring 2014.
