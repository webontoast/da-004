O﻿ur project to build a mansard roof extension with a roof terrace is nearing completion.

 We worked hard with structural engineers, Consibee and the main contractor, LLAC to ensure that the use of steel in this project was kept to a minimum. In the end, we managed to do it with just one steel beam, with the rest of the structure being timber. This is a more sustainable way of building and it is lighter and easier to manage on site. For many areas of construction detailing, the timber structure also has the added benefit of improving the thermal performance of the building – this is because timber forms less of a “cold bridge” from outside to inside as it is a better insulator than steel. 

Our clients are looking forward to moving into their new roof space and using their new roof terrace this summer.
