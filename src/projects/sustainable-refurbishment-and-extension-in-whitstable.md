Our client wanted to increase the size of the existing detached single storey house. We looked into the idea of demolishing the existing house and building a new, bigger one in its place. However, we decided that improving the existing house and then extending it would be a more sustainable and in the end, more interesting and appropriate way to go about the project.



As with many of our recent projects, we have arranged the design to accommodate home work spaces â€“ in this case a photography studio and a small office space.



Recent changes in the building regulations have resulted in the requirement for increased levels of insulation in walls, floors and roofs, which is a good thing and we have been working closely with the main contractor and the approved inspector for building control to make sure that we deliver the most sustainable project that we can.



The landscaping around the extended building will be completely re-worked and we are looking forward to seeing the numerous sun traps around the building when the new plants have bedded in.



Planning permission for this project was granted by Canterbury City Council in mid 2022 and construction is due for completion in autumn 2023.
