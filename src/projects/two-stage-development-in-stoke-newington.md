This project involved renovating the existing terraced family house, adding a loft extension and adding a rear ground floor extension. The loft extension and upper storey renovation work were kept as simple and straightforward as possible, so that we could concentrate on the new kitchen and dining area at ground floor level.

Our intention for the new ground floor space was to play down the functional role of the kitchen and to focus on the social and day-to-day aspect of the kitchen and dining space as a whole.

Layouts and finishes were agreed during close and lengthy discussions with our clients, who were very hands-on when it came to choosing materials and colours and when defining the feel of the space.

During the construction process the ideas and assumptions about the space were continually challenged and tested and we found that as a design team we benefited from regularly returning to the original ideas and intentions. Our clients input in this area was a great way to ensure that the end result was definitely their own making â€“ and we are all really pleased with the result.

The construction work for this project was carried out in two stages. First of all, the loft extension was completed, then the ground and first floors were renovated and extended. This drew out the construction period, but it allowed our clients to stay in the property throughout the construction work. This was messy and at times pretty difficult, but it did save on additional costs. More importantly, it meant that our clients had time to develop a very good rapport with the builders, which was good for ironing out all the final details.

Aluminium windows were from Express Bi-folding Doors. The kitchen was made up from carcasses from Howdens with doors supplied by Naked Doors. The kitchen worktop was supplied by MKW Surfaces.

Structural engineers for the project were Conisbee, Approved inspectors for Building Control were London Building Control, Party Wall Surveyors were Peter Barry and the main contractor was JRT Lofts Limited.
