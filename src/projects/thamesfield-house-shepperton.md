We renovated and extended a listed building in Shepperton in order to produce 5 flats for sale by a developer. Parts of the building had not been worked on or repaired sine the 1970s and so a lot of work was required. In order to make the flat plans work, we needed to extend the building as well as modify the interior layouts. Together with the client, we felt that there was a possibility that a carefully designed new building could be built within the grounds of the existing building.

We designed a new two bedroom house to sit close to the existing building. We felt that with the detail in the new building being  restrained, the detail in the proposed building should be focused mainly on the choice of materials and textures.
