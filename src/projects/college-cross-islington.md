Completed while working at Douglas and King Architects, we were architects for this refurbishment and extension project on a grade 2 listed building in College Cross in Islington.

Our design intentions were double sided – we wanted to express a clear distinction between new and old at the same time as blurring the boundaries between inside and outside. We treated the project as a landscape rather than a building and we were particularly sensitive to textures, surfaces, and connectivity.

The new glass extension is set down so that it doesn’t disturb the living room’s flow towards the garden. The project value was £105,000.

We like the way these materials sit together; the polished concrete floor works really well with the oak stair and the galvanised steel structure and framing.
