An easy way to make room for a new bedroom.

body:
We have completed our second garden office in Stoke Newington. This office is built on the same principles as our first one – low impact foundations, timber framed structure and cedar cladding to the outer skin.

We had to squeeze this office into the space at the end of the garden, underneath an apple tree. The structure and foundations had to be designed to accommodate these tight site constraints.

The interior is just big enough to fit in a generously sized desk and all of the files and books that come with any well used home work space. The small outdoor area in front of the office that is defined by the decking and the green oak pergola serves to act as a buffer between the garden and the office. The office also contains a garden storage room – or shed within an shed. This room accessed by the cedar clad door on the left hand side ion the front elevation. The preservation of the apple tree, the outdoor buffer zone and the garden storage area were all key components of the clients’ original brief and we are all please that while we have accommodated all of these constraints, the resulting structure has benefitted the existing garden.

By moving the home office out into the garden a room has been made available in the house for another bedroom, which the owners’ growing family needed.
