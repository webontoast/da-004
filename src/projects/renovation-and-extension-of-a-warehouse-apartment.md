We worked closely with our client to renovate and extend her warehouse apartment in Islington. The design involved extending the apartment into a section of unused space at the top of the communal stairs in the building and it involved adding a large roof light in the existing stairwell inside the apartment. The project required planning permission, which we arranged and it required agreement with the freeholder and we assisted the solicitors in the negotiations for this.

As part of the design we installed a mural in the stairwell and we assisted our client in choosing interior fittings and furniture to complete the project.
