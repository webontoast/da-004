Our project to extend and remodel a ground floor flat in Stoke Newington is now complete. The clients’ brief was to extend the property and remodel the interior in order to provide a third bedroom, to increase the size of the living area, to add an ensuite bathroom, a utility room and loads of new easily accessible storage space. To achieve all this, the interior of the flat has been completely remodelled and a substantial extension has been added at the rear.

In-depth discussions with the planners revealed the opportunity to maximise the height of the rear extension giving us an interior floor to ceiling height of 3.75m, and this gives the new living area a fantastic feeling of light and space, so the contrast between smaller tranquil bedroom and work spaces plays nicely against the big, bright living area.

We worked closely with our clients on the overall layout of the project and the clients took the lead on the interior design, which we think has worked brilliantly. We worked with structural engineers Conisbee to get over some surprisingly tricky structural issues on the project and we worked with the main contractor, JT Lofts to overcome the difficulties presented to us by a building that had been substantially altered in the past and needed a lot of work to be done to it to bring it up to standard. Other members of the team who helped make this difficult project possible were Thames Building Control for building control approval and Peter Barry Surveyors for party wall matters. This was not an easy project to complete but the client, design and construction team really like the end result.
