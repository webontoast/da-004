Our project to refurbish, remodel and extend a Victorian terraced house in Allerton Road, Stoke Newington is now finished.

We completed the outline design stage and achieved planning permission for the job in 2012 – 2013. We subsequently set up the tender documents and assisted the client with arranging the main construction contract and the start on site for the construction work. At that point, and as planned from the outset, the client took the job on to see it through to completion, maintaining control of the interior design and visual impact of the job.

As with some of our other projects, this is the result of close collaboration between the clients, the architect and the builder, JT Lofts. The photos clearly demonstrate the clients’ fantastic eye for detail. What is less obvious from the photos, but equally important is the way that the clients and the main contractor worked to make the best use of every square centimeter in the house.
