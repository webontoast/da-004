We have been working on the designs for a new house looking on to Wanstead Flats. The scheme was granted planning permission in November 2015.

The design is based around the notion of a tree house with timber structure and cladding at first floor and roof level and brick work at ground floor level.

We have put the kitchen and living areas on the first floor in order to maximise the views over Wanstead Flats and we have added a small secluded roof terrace to give us the full tree house feeling. The bedrooms are on the ground floor along with a small private courtyard at the back.

It will be a small house, but it will be full of big surprises.
