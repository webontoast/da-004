This roof extension forms a new addition to the varied landscape of roof top architecture in Hoxton square.

The form of this zink clad roof extension is determined by its use, by its location, by the shape of the existing host building and by a desire to create a subtle and careful addition to the Hoxton Square roof line. It is designed a homogeneous structural shell with openings punched into it. Edges are cut back to reduce sight-lines from street level, roof lights have been incorporated to produce lighting that is suitable for office use and in order to produce interesting and beautiful working volumes within.

The project was completed in November 2013.
