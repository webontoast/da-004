Our clients wanted to add a new bedroom and bathroom to their maisonette in Stoke Newington. A mansard loft extension seemed like the obvious solution for this. However, they also wanted some outdoor space, so we looked into possible locations for a roof terrace and eventually settled on making the terrace part of the mansard extension project.

We achieved planning permission for the project in 2022 and work started on site in early 2023.

We worked with structural engineers, Conisbee and the main contractor LLAC to design and build as much of the structure as possible in timber. This is a more sustainable way of building and it is lighter and easier to manage on site. For many areas of construction detailing, the timber structure also has the added benefit of improving the thermal performance of the building – this is because timber forms less of a “cold bridge” from outside to inside as it is a better insulator than steel.

Storage was another important aspect of the design. Our clients were very keen to make sure that we included storage wherever possible in the project and overall, we think that the final design struck a good balance between providing a good sized spaces for the bedroom, the bathroom, the roof terrace and storage space.
