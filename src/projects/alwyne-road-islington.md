We refurbished this listed building in Islington with good collaboration with the local authority planning and conservation team. The brief was to combine two separate flats into one maisonette and to install an invisible kitchen into the new lower floor. We designed the kitchen as a piece of walnut clad furniture that also contained a drinks cabinet and entertainment centre.
