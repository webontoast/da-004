Our project in Denham, Suffolk to renovate and extend a brick cottage is now complete although the landscaping is currently underway. Together with the clients, we spent a lot of time at the beginning of the project testing out the interior layouts in order to find the plan forms that answered the brief. We were all keen to make sure that the final design retained some of the feel of the old cottage â€“ but at the same time allowed the new spaces to work well in their own right. Attention was paid to making sure that the plans were simple and straightforward and that views were opened up where possible.

The rear extension is full width. It allowed us to increase the size of the kitchen and living areas. It has a flat roof which is covered with sedum. An oak balcony has been added to the gable end of the cottage. This balcony also serves as a canopy over the main entrance door.

We will be uploading more photos of the job soon!
