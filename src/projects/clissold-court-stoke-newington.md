This project involved the refurbishment of a very run down 1930s apartment in Stoke Newington. We acted as designers and project managers for the construction work which included scheduling the individual trades and keeping a close eye on a very tight budget. We kept the main features of the building while we completely rewired it, installed central heating and refurbished it. We also introduced a sound proof ceiling as the concrete floors in the building transmit impact sound incredibly well and, nice though the neighbours are, we didn’t want to be able to hear them walking around on a quiet Sunday morning. The project was completed in 2013 with a construction cost of £35,000.
