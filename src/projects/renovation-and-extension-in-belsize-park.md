In November 2015 we completed the refurbishment, remodeling and extension of a 1960’s terraced house in Belsize Park. The project was the result of a close collaboration with the clients, first stage design architects AND.gb and Douglas Architects.

Concept design, planning and tender drawings were all prepared by AND.gb. Douglas Architects then became involved in the project and acted as Contract Administrator for the project while it was being built. We also carried out the detail design for the building envelope while site works were underway. We saw ourselves as a kind of midwife for the project rather than as lead designers;  We acted as facilitators and communicators between the client, the design team and the main contractor.

AND.gb remained involved with the project throughout so we continued to work together with them as well as the structural engineers Aleck Associates. We also worked with main contractor Noble Houses and sub-contractors Wilder Creative in order to ensure that the original vision for the project was carried through to completion.

Our clients successfully took on the role of interior designers and designers for the mechanical and electrical installation. They left no stone unturned in the search for finding the right fixtures and finishes, for finding ways to bring light into the house and for finding ways to make the house as energy efficient as possible.
