We worked closely with our clients to produce this bright, sculptural rear extension in West Hampstead.

The site was constrained by the heights of the neighboring boundary structures, so we came up with a form for the rear extension that worked within those constraints, while at the same time allowing us to give the rear elevation and the interior spaces a character that worked for them and worked well with the rest of the house.

Careful positioning of roof lights and door openings developed the character of the spaces further and the design of the lighting layout completed the overall picture.

The design and construction team worked well together on this project: The structural engineers developed their designs during construction in order to minimise waste that could have resulted from a requirement to dig out the existing foundations and floor slabs on the site. We worked together with the clients and the builder to achieve a very high quality finish and the clients were instrumental in the design of the kitchen and the very tightly specified designs and layouts for lighting, power and data.

The project was completed in May 2022.
